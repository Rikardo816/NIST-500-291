    <section>
        <p>
            Innovation in IT means that IT standards are constantly being developed, approved, and maintained.
            Revisions to previous editions of standards may or may not be backward-compatible. Table 4 – 
            Standards Maturity Model provides an indication of the maturity level of a standard. Some SDOs 
            require two or more implementations before final approval of a standard. Such implementations 
            may or may not be commercially available products or services. In other cases, an SDO may be 
            developing standards while commercial products or services are already being sold that conform to 
            early drafts. (In such cases, companies take on the risk of creating products or services that may not 
            conform to the final standard.)
